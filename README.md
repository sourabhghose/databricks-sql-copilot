> **Alpha software.** This project is in early alpha. APIs, features, and behaviour may change without notice. There are no guarantees of correctness, completeness, or fitness for any purpose. **Do not rely on this tool for production decisions without independent validation.**

A Databricks App that surfaces slow and expensive SQL queries, monitors Databricks Jobs health, diagnoses performance bottlenecks, and generates AI-powered optimizations — all from data you already have in system tables.

Built with Next.js, shadcn/ui, and the Databricks SQL Node.js driver. Deploys natively to [Databricks Apps](https://docs.databricks.com/en/apps/index.html) with on-behalf-of-user (OBO) authentication — queries run under the logged-in user's identity with their Unity Catalog permissions.

## What it does

SQL Observability Co-Pilot reads your Databricks system tables to find the queries and jobs that cost the most, run the slowest, or cause the most pressure on your warehouses. It then uses Databricks-hosted AI models to explain what's wrong and suggest fixes.

### SQL Observability
1. **Discovers** slow and high-impact SQL queries from `system.query.history` across all warehouses
2. **Scores** each query pattern by real business impact (runtime, frequency, cost, capacity pressure, quick-win potential)
3. **Monitors** warehouse activity in real time with interactive query timelines, I/O heatmaps, and user/source breakdowns
4. **Triages** queries with fast AI insights (one-liner per pattern, auto-generated)
5. **Diagnoses** root causes using AI with full context (table metadata, maintenance history, warehouse config)
6. **Proposes** optimised SQL rewrites with risks, rationale, and validation plans
7. **Analyses warehouse health** with sizing, scaling, and serverless migration recommendations

### Jobs Health Monitoring
8. **Tracks** all Databricks Jobs from `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline` with KPI tiles (total runs, success rate, p95 duration, total cost) and week-over-week comparison
9. **Ranks** jobs by failure rate and duration, with per-job cost allocation from `system.billing.usage`
10. **Drills down** into individual jobs with run timeline, daily duration trend (p50/p95/avg), task-level breakdown, phase analysis (setup/queue/execution), and run comparison
11. **Triages** each job with AI-generated one-liner insights referencing specific metrics
12. **Analyses** jobs in depth with AI: root cause diagnosis, phase bottleneck identification, cluster right-sizing, and retry pattern analysis
13. **Flags** jobs with rule-based detection (high failure rate, long setup, queue bottleneck, duration volatility, etc.)

### Cross-Cutting
14. **Generates** Operator Actions Summary: AI-powered top-10 prioritised action items spanning SQL queries, jobs, and table optimization — with specific commands, owners, and quantified impact

### The app is read-only

SQL Observability Co-Pilot does **not** create, modify, or delete anything in your lakehouse. It only reads system tables and calls `ai_query()`. No tables are created, no data is written to Unity Catalog, and no warehouse settings are changed.

## Features

### Dashboard

Cross-warehouse overview with KPI tiles, AI triage insights, expandable query rows, time analysis, and filtering by warehouse, workspace, time range, and performance flags. Sort by impact, cost, p95 runtime, or frequency.

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/3.png" alt="Dashboard — expanded query detail" width="100%" />
  <br />
  <em>Expanding a query row reveals execution details, performance flags, and AI triage insights</em>
</p>

### Warehouse Monitor

Real-time warehouse monitoring with:
- Interactive query timeline (drag to zoom, click to inspect individual queries)
- Running/queued slot metrics and throughput charts
- I/O heatmap, duration histogram, top users, and source breakdown
- AI-generated insights per query
- CSV export of all query data
- Auto-refresh (live mode)

</p>

### AI Query Analysis

Single-click diagnosis and rewrite generation. The AI receives rich context including column types, table maintenance history (OPTIMIZE, VACUUM, ANALYZE), and warehouse configuration. Results include root causes, an optimised SQL rewrite, risks, and a validation plan. Copy the rewrite to your clipboard or open the SQL editor to test it.

  <em>AI-powered root cause diagnosis with optimised SQL rewrite, risk assessment, and validation plan</em>
</p>

### How optimization advice works

The app uses a multi-layer approach: deterministic rule-based detection (15 performance flags with quantified impact thresholds), a 5-factor weighted impact scoring model, warehouse sizing recommendations based on 7-day sustained-pressure analysis, and AI-powered triage and deep analysis enriched with Unity Catalog table metadata.

For full details on every threshold, formula, detection rule, and AI prompt — see **[OPTIMIZATION_LOGIC.md](OPTIMIZATION_LOGIC.md)**.

## What Databricks services does this app use?

This section explains exactly what the app interacts with so you can assess security, permissions, and cost.

### System tables (read-only)

The app runs `SELECT` queries against these system tables via your SQL Warehouse:

| System table | What it reads | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `system.query.history` | Query text, execution metrics, user info | Core data source for SQL query analysis |
| `system.compute.warehouses` | Warehouse names, sizes, config | Warehouse health recommendations |
| `system.compute.clusters` | Cluster metadata | Genie Space context |
| `system.billing.usage` | DBU consumption per warehouse/job | Cost estimation for SQL queries and jobs |
| `system.billing.list_prices` | SKU pricing | Converts DBUs to dollar amounts |
| `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline` | Job run metrics, durations, results | Jobs Health dashboard and detail pages |
| `system.lakeflow.job_task_run_timeline` | Task-level metrics per job run | Task breakdown on job detail page |
| `system.lakeflow.jobs` | Job metadata (names, creators, schedules) | Job name resolution and creator filters |
| `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Workspace names and URLs | Multi-workspace support (optional) |
| `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` | Column names and types | Context for AI analysis |

The app also calls `DESCRIBE DETAIL`, `DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED`, and `describe_history()` on tables referenced by slow queries to gather maintenance history for AI context.

All system table queries use **date partition pruning** (e.g., `WHERE start_time >= dateadd(...)`) to minimise scan size.

### Databricks REST APIs (read-only)

The Warehouse Monitor uses these REST APIs for real-time data:

| API endpoint | What it reads | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/2.0/sql/warehouses` | Warehouse list and state | Monitor page warehouse list |
| `GET /api/2.0/sql/warehouses/{id}` | Individual warehouse detail | Warehouse config display |
| `GET /api/2.0/sql/warehouses/{id}/stats` | Running/queued commands, active clusters | Live cluster and query counts |
| `GET /api/2.0/sql/history/queries` | Recent query history with metadata | Timeline and query table |
| `GET /api/2.0/sql/history/endpoint-metrics` | Slot utilisation and throughput metrics | Warehouse metrics charts |

REST API calls are authenticated using the logged-in user's OBO token (default) or the service principal's OAuth token (when `AUTH_MODE=sp`).

### AI models (via `ai_query()` — pay-per-token)

The app calls Databricks-hosted foundation models through the `ai_query()` SQL function. Both models use **pay-per-token (PPT)** billing — inference costs are billed per token consumed, separate from your SQL Warehouse DBUs.

| Model | Used for | When it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | Fast triage insights (one-liner per query) | Automatically on dashboard load and warehouse monitor "AI Insights" button |
| `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | Deep diagnosis and SQL rewrites | Only when you click "AI Analyse" on a specific query |

AI features are **optional**. If `ai_query()` is not available or the service principal lacks access, the app still works — you just won't see AI insights or rewrites. No AI calls are made without user action (triage runs on page load but fails gracefully).

### Lakebase / PostgreSQL (optional, disabled by default)

When `ENABLE_LAKEBASE=true`, the app persists three small cache tables to a Databricks Lakebase (managed PostgreSQL) instance. See [Persistence](#persistence-lakebase--optional) below. This is entirely optional and disabled by default.

### Nothing else

The app does not:
- Write to Unity Catalog or Delta tables
- Create or modify warehouses
- Access cloud storage (S3, ADLS, GCS)
- Make external API calls outside your Databricks workspace
- Send telemetry or analytics anywhere
- Require internet access at runtime (all dependencies are bundled at build time)

---

## Estimated costs

> **Quick summary** — For a team that uses the app a few hours per day on AWS Premium, expect roughly **$20–$50/month** total (app hosting + warehouse DBUs + AI pay-per-token). AI and Lakebase are optional and add a few dollars more. See below for full breakdown.

### SQL Warehouse compute

The app runs queries against system tables using your existing SQL Warehouse. Costs depend on your warehouse type and size:

| Activity | Approximate DBU usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard load | ~0.01–0.05 DBU | 4–6 system table queries with partition pruning |
| Warehouse Health analysis | ~0.02–0.10 DBU | 5 parallel queries over a 7-day window |
| Warehouse Monitor (per refresh) | ~0.01 DBU | REST API calls (free) + lightweight SQL queries |

> **Note**: AI model inference (triage and deep analysis) is billed separately as pay-per-token — see below. The warehouse only incurs a small SQL execution overhead for `ai_query()` calls, not the inference cost itself.

**Typical monthly cost for moderate use** (10 dashboard loads/day): **$3–$10/month** in warehouse DBUs, depending on warehouse size and pricing tier.

### Foundation Model APIs — pay-per-token (PPT)

All AI features use Databricks Foundation Model APIs via `ai_query()` with **pay-per-token** billing. Inference costs are billed per token consumed, separate from warehouse DBU charges. Refer to the [Databricks Foundation Model APIs pricing page](https://www.databricks.com/product/pricing/foundation-model-training-and-serving) for current per-token rates.

| Feature | Model | Typical tokens per call | Approximate cost per call |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI triage (batch of ~10 queries) | `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | ~2K–5K input, ~1K output | < $0.01 |
| AI deep analysis (per query) | `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | ~5K–30K input, ~4K–8K output | ~$0.05–$0.30 |
| AI SQL rewrite (per query) | `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | ~10K–50K input, ~4K–16K output | ~$0.10–$0.50 |

**Typical monthly cost for moderate use** (10 triage batches/day, 5 deep analyses/day): **$5–$15/month** in PPT token costs. Costs scale linearly with usage — if you run fewer analyses, you pay less.

### Lakebase (if enabled)

Lakebase XS instance: approximately **$25/month**. The app stores only a few hundred rows of cache data, so the smallest instance is sufficient. **This is optional and disabled by default.**

### Databricks Apps hosting

Databricks Apps are billed per DBU based on app size and uptime. Pricing varies by cloud and tier — always refer to the [official Databricks Apps pricing page](https://www.databricks.com/product/pricing/databricks-apps) for current rates.

| App size | DBU per hour | Example: 24/7 for 30 days |
|---|---|---|
| Medium | 0.5 DBU/hr | 360 DBU/month |
| Large | 1.0 DBU/hr | 720 DBU/month |

**Example cost** (AWS Premium, US-East): A single Medium app running 24/7 for 30 days = 360 DBUs x $0.75/DBU = **~$270/month**.

**Cost optimisation tip**: SQL Observability Co-Pilot does not need to run 24/7. You can **stop the app** when not in use and **start it** only when you need to analyse queries or review warehouse health. If you run the app for ~2 hours per business day (22 days/month), the cost drops to approximately **$16.50/month** for a Medium app on AWS Premium.

To stop/start your app:
- **UI**: Go to **Compute > Apps**, click your app, then **Stop** / **Start**
- **CLI**: `databricks apps stop <app-name>` / `databricks apps start <app-name>`

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] A **Databricks workspace** (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- [ ] A **SQL Warehouse** (Serverless or Pro) — the app runs all queries through this warehouse
- [ ] **Admin or metastore admin** access to grant permissions on system tables
- [ ] The **Databricks CLI** installed on your local machine ([installation guide](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html))
- [ ] **Node.js 22+** and **npm** installed ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- [ ] (Optional) A **Lakebase** instance if you want persistent caching

---

## Deployment guide (Databricks Apps)

This is the recommended deployment method. Follow every step in order.

### Step 1: Install the Databricks CLI

If you haven't already, install and authenticate the Databricks CLI:

```bash
# Install (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
databricks --version

# Configure authentication to your workspace
databricks configure
```

When prompted:
- **Host**: Enter your workspace URL (e.g., `https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com`)
- **Token**: Enter a personal access token ([how to create one](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html))

Verify the connection:

```bash
databricks warehouses list
```

You should see your SQL warehouses listed.

### Step 2: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd databricks-sql-copilot
```

### Step 3: Create the Databricks App

In your Databricks workspace UI:

1. Navigate to **Compute** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Apps**
3. Click **Create App**
4. Enter a name: `dbsql-copilot` (or your preferred name)
5. Click **Create**

The app is now created but not yet deployed. Note the app name — you'll need it for the deploy command.

### Step 4: Add a SQL Warehouse resource

The app needs access to a SQL Warehouse to run queries.

1. On your app's page, click the **Resources** tab (or **Configure**)
2. Click **+ Add resource**
3. Select **SQL Warehouse**
4. Choose the warehouse you want the app to use
5. Set the **Resource key** to: `sql-warehouse`
6. Set **Permission** to: **Can use**
7. Click **Save**

> **Which warehouse should I use?** Any Serverless or Pro warehouse works. The app's queries are lightweight (system table SELECTs with partition pruning), so a Small Serverless warehouse is sufficient. You can use an existing warehouse — the app's queries will have minimal impact on other workloads.

### Step 5: Configure user authorization scopes

The app uses **on-behalf-of-user (OBO) authentication** by default — all SQL queries and REST API calls run under the logged-in user's identity with their Unity Catalog permissions. This requires user authorization scopes to be configured.

1. On your app's page, click the **Resources** tab (or **Configure**)
2. Scroll down to **User authorization** (Preview section)
3. Click **+ Add scope** and add the following scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|---|---|
| `sql` | Allow the app to execute SQL and manage SQL related resources |
| `catalog.tables:read` | Allow the app to read tables in Unity Catalog |
| `catalog.schemas:read` | Allow the app to read schemas in Unity Catalog |
| `catalog.catalogs:read` | Allow the app to read catalogs in Unity Catalog |

4. Click **Save**

> **What does this do?** When a user opens the app for the first time, they will be prompted to consent to these scopes. Once consented, all queries run as that user — their Unity Catalog permissions (including row-level filters and column masks) are enforced automatically. This also enables proper audit trails in `system.query.history`.
>
> **Service principal fallback:** If you prefer all users to share the service principal's permissions (pre-OBO behaviour), set `AUTH_MODE=sp` in the app's environment variables. See [Environment variables](#environment-variables) below.

### Step 6: Grant system table permissions

Permission requirements depend on your `AUTH_MODE`:

- **OBO mode (default):** Each user who opens the app needs `SELECT` access to the system tables below. The service principal only needs **Can use** on the SQL Warehouse. Granting permissions to a **group** (e.g., `platform-admins`) is the easiest approach.
- **SP mode (`AUTH_MODE=sp`):** The service principal needs all the permissions itself, since it runs every query.

In both cases, find the service principal name on your app's **Settings** tab (looks like `dbsql-copilot-app-sp`).

```sql
-- Service principal: warehouse access (required in both modes)
-- (This is configured via the resource binding in Step 4, but verify CAN USE is granted)

-- Grant to users (OBO mode) or to the service principal (SP mode).
-- Replace <principal> with a group name, user email, or the service principal name.

-- SQL Dashboard
GRANT SELECT ON system.query.history TO `<principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON system.compute.warehouses TO `<principal>`;

-- Jobs Health
GRANT SELECT ON system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline TO `<principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON system.lakeflow.job_task_run_timeline TO `<principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON system.lakeflow.jobs TO `<principal>`;

-- Cost estimation (SQL + Jobs)
GRANT SELECT ON system.billing.usage TO `<principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON system.billing.list_prices TO `<principal>`;

-- Multi-workspace support (optional — dashboard works without it)
GRANT SELECT ON system.access.workspaces_latest TO `<principal>`;

-- AI features (optional — skip if you don't want AI analysis)
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION ai_query TO `<principal>`;
```

> **Note**: If you are a **metastore admin**, you can grant these permissions. If not, ask your metastore admin to run these statements.

### Step 7: Upload and deploy

From the cloned repository directory:

```bash
# Upload the source code to your workspace
databricks sync . /Workspace/Users/<your-email>/dbsql-copilot

# Deploy the app (in a separate terminal)
databricks apps deploy dbsql-copilot \
  --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/<your-email>/dbsql-copilot
```

Replace `<your-email>` with your Databricks workspace email.

The deployment process will:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to create a production build
3. Start the app on the platform-assigned port

This takes **2–5 minutes** on first deploy.

### Step 8: Verify the deployment

1. Go back to **Compute > Apps** in your workspace
2. Click on your app
3. Once the status shows **Running**, click the app URL to open it
4. You should see the dashboard with your query data loading

If you see errors, check the **Logs** tab on your app's page.

### Step 9: Iterate during development (optional)

For ongoing development, use `--watch` mode to auto-sync changes:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch for file changes and sync
databricks sync --watch . /Workspace/Users/<your-email>/dbsql-copilot

# Terminal 2: Re-deploy after changes
databricks apps deploy dbsql-copilot \
  --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/<your-email>/dbsql-copilot
```

---

## Alternative: Deploy directly from GitHub (Beta)

Instead of uploading files with `databricks sync`, you can deploy directly from a Git repository. This is a Beta feature that a workspace admin must enable first. See the [official documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/deploy/#deploy-from-a-git-repository) for full details.

### Prerequisites

- A workspace admin must enable the **Git-based app deployment** preview feature in your workspace
- The repository must be accessible from your Databricks workspace (public repos work immediately; private repos require a Git credential)

### Steps

1. **Fork or clone this repository** to your own GitHub (or GitLab / Bitbucket) account
2. **Create the app** following Steps 3–6 from the deployment guide above (create app, add SQL Warehouse resource, configure user authorization, grant permissions)
3. **Configure the Git repository**:
   - On your app's page, click **Edit**
   - In the **Configure Git repository** step, enter your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/your-org/databricks-sql-copilot`)
   - Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
   - Click **Save**
4. **Add a Git credential** (private repos only):
   - On the app details page, click **Configure Git credential**
   - Follow the prompts for your Git provider (typically a personal access token)
5. **Deploy from Git**:
   - Click **Deploy**
   - Select **From Git**
   - Enter the **Git reference**: `main` (or a branch name, tag, or commit SHA)
   - Select the **Reference type**: Branch
   - Click **Deploy**

The app will pull the code directly from your repository, run the build, and start. To redeploy after pushing changes to Git, simply click **Deploy** again — no need to re-sync files.

> **Note**: Changing the Git repository or switching between Git and workspace deployment sources deletes all stored Git credentials for the app's service principal. You will need to reconfigure credentials after switching.

---

## Quick deploy with the deploy script

The easiest way to deploy to any workspace. Handles app creation, source sync, deployment, and OBO scope configuration in one command.

### First deploy to a new workspace

```bash
# Authenticate to the target workspace
databricks auth login https://my-workspace.cloud.databricks.com --profile=my-workspace

# Deploy (creates app + syncs + deploys)
./scripts/deploy.sh \
  --profile my-workspace \
  --warehouse abc123def456 \
  --create
```

### Redeploy after code changes

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --profile my-workspace --warehouse abc123def456
```

### Full options

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh \
  --profile my-workspace \        # Databricks CLI profile (required)
  --warehouse abc123def456 \      # SQL warehouse ID (required)
  --app-name sql-obs-copilot \    # App name (default: sql-obs-copilot)
  --auth-mode obo \               # obo or sp (default: obo)
  --genie-space <space-id> \      # Genie Space ID (optional)
  --create                        # Create app if it doesn't exist
```

### Post-deploy checklist

After the script completes, it prints the app's service principal ID. You (or a workspace admin) need to:

1. **Grant the SP `CAN_USE` on the SQL warehouse** (via Databricks UI: SQL Warehouses > Permissions)
2. **Grant system table `SELECT`** (see [Permissions reference](#permissions-reference))
3. If using Genie: **Grant the SP `CAN_RUN` on the Genie Space**

---

## Deploy with Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB)

For repeatable, multi-environment deployments managed as code.

### Bundle structure

```
databricks-sql-copilot/
├── databricks.yml          # Bundle config with targets
├── resources/
│   └── app.yml             # App resource definition
├── app.yaml                # Runtime env vars (per-target via deploy script)
└── ...                     # App source code
```

### Targets

The bundle ships with two pre-configured targets in `databricks.yml`:

| Target | Profile | Warehouse | Auth |
|--------|---------|-----------|------|
| `dev` (default) | `DEFAULT` | `75fd8278393d07eb` | SP |
| `alinta-prod` | `alinta_prod_user` | `bfe02b96b14128c0` | OBO |

### Adding a new target

Edit `databricks.yml`:

```yaml
targets:
  # ... existing targets ...

  customer-demo:
    workspace:
      profile: customer-workspace
    variables:
      warehouse_id: "their-warehouse-id"
      auth_mode: "obo"
      genie_space_id: ""
```

### Commands

```bash
# Validate
databricks bundle validate -t dev

# Deploy
databricks bundle deploy -t alinta-prod

# Start the app after first deploy
databricks bundle run sql_observability_copilot -t alinta-prod

# Tear down
databricks bundle destroy -t dev
```

> **Note**: The DAB approach names the app `sql-obs-copilot-<target>` (e.g., `sql-obs-copilot-dev`). The deploy script approach uses a flat name you specify with `--app-name`. Both work; choose one per workspace.

---

## Local development

For developing locally before deploying:

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
cd databricks-sql-copilot
npm install
```

### Step 2: Create your environment file

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

### Step 3: Configure your environment

Edit `.env.local` with your values:

```bash
# Your workspace URL (must include https://)
DATABRICKS_HOST=https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com

# A personal access token (Workspace > User Settings > Developer > Access Tokens > Generate)
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=dapiXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Your SQL warehouse ID
# Find it: Workspace > SQL Warehouses > click your warehouse > the ID is in the URL
# e.g., https://your-workspace.../sql/warehouses/abcdef1234567890 → DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID=abcdef1234567890
DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID=abcdef1234567890
```

### Step 4: Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Note**: For local development, the personal access token (PAT) is used for authentication regardless of the `AUTH_MODE` setting — OBO tokens are only available when the app is deployed to Databricks Apps. Ensure your PAT belongs to a user with the system table permissions listed in Step 6 of the deployment guide.

---

## Persistence (Lakebase) — optional

Persistence is **disabled by default**. The app works fully without it. Enabling it adds:

- **AI rewrite cache** — Avoids re-running expensive AI analysis on the same query (7-day TTL)
- **Query actions** — Remembers when you dismiss, watch, or mark a query as applied (30-day TTL)
- **Health trend tracking** — Compares warehouse health between analysis runs (90-day TTL)

Without persistence, AI analysis runs fresh each time and dismissed queries reappear after restart.

### Enabling persistence (Databricks Apps — auto-provisioned)

When deployed as a Databricks App, Lakebase is **auto-provisioned**. No manual database setup, no secrets, no resource bindings for the database. The app uses the platform-injected service principal credentials to create and manage its own Lakebase Autoscale project.

#### 1. Add `ENABLE_LAKEBASE` to `app.yaml`

Add the environment variable to your `app.yaml`:

```yaml
env:
  - name: DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID
    valueFrom: sql-warehouse
  - name: ENABLE_LAKEBASE
    value: "true"
```

#### 2. Deploy

Deploy (or re-deploy) the app. On first boot with `ENABLE_LAKEBASE=true`, the startup script will:

1. **Create a Lakebase Autoscale project** (`dbsql-copilot`) using the app's service principal
2. **Generate short-lived OAuth DB credentials** (rotated automatically every ~50 minutes at runtime)
3. **Push the Prisma schema** (`prisma db push`) to create all tables

Subsequent deploys detect the existing project and skip creation (~1-2s).

#### 3. Verify

Check the health endpoint or app logs to confirm Lakebase is connected.

### Enabling persistence (local development)

For local dev, set `DATABASE_URL` directly in `.env.local`:

```bash
ENABLE_LAKEBASE=true
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/databricks_postgres?sslmode=require
```

No credential rotation is needed locally — the static URL is used directly.

### Persistence troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| App works but no caching | `ENABLE_LAKEBASE` not set to `true` | Add it to `app.yaml` env section |
| `Lakebase provisioning returned empty URL` | SP lacks permission to create Lakebase projects | Ensure the app's service principal can manage Lakebase resources |
| `Create project failed (403)` | Lakebase Autoscale not available in region | Check supported regions; fall back to manual `DATABASE_URL` |
| Schema push fails at startup | Lakebase compute still waking from scale-to-zero | Restart the app — compute wakes automatically and retries succeed |
| `DATABASE_URL is not set` (local dev) | Missing `.env.local` | Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` for local dev |

## Permissions reference

### OBO mode (default — `AUTH_MODE=obo`)

In OBO mode, queries execute under the **logged-in user's** identity. Each user must have the necessary permissions on system tables. The service principal still needs warehouse access for the initial connection.

| Who | Permission | Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Service principal** | **Can use** | Your SQL Warehouse | Establish SQL connections |
| **Each user** | **SELECT** | `system.query.history` | SQL query analysis |
| **Each user** | **SELECT** | `system.compute.warehouses` | Warehouse health/monitor |
| **Each user** | **SELECT** | `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline` | Jobs Health dashboard |
| **Each user** | **SELECT** | `system.lakeflow.job_task_run_timeline` | Job task breakdown |
| **Each user** | **SELECT** | `system.lakeflow.jobs` | Job metadata (names, creators) |
| **Each user** | **SELECT** | `system.billing.usage` | Cost allocation (SQL + Jobs) |
| **Each user** | **SELECT** | `system.billing.list_prices` | Dollar cost estimation |
| **Each user** | **SELECT** | `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Workspace names (optional) |

> **Tip:** Granting system table access to a group (e.g., `platform-admins`) is easier than granting per-user. Users who lack a specific permission see graceful degradation (e.g., cost columns show "N/A", workspace names show "Unknown").

### Service principal mode (`AUTH_MODE=sp`)

In SP mode, all queries run as the service principal regardless of who is logged in. Grant the same permissions above to the service principal instead.

| Permission | Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Can use** | Your SQL Warehouse | Run queries against system tables |
| **SELECT** | `system.query.history` | SQL query analysis |
| **SELECT** | `system.compute.warehouses` | Warehouse health/monitor |
| **SELECT** | `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline` | Jobs Health dashboard |
| **SELECT** | `system.lakeflow.job_task_run_timeline` | Job task breakdown |
| **SELECT** | `system.lakeflow.jobs` | Job metadata (names, creators) |
| **SELECT** | `system.billing.usage` | Cost allocation (SQL + Jobs) |
| **SELECT** | `system.billing.list_prices` | Dollar cost estimation |
| **SELECT** | `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Workspace names (optional) |

### Optional permissions (both modes)

| Permission | Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **EXECUTE** | `ai_query()` function | AI triage, diagnosis, and rewrite features |
| **SELECT** | `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` | Column type context for AI analysis |
| **SELECT** | `describe_history()` on user tables | Table maintenance history for AI context |
| **Can connect** | Lakebase database | Persistent caching (when `ENABLE_LAKEBASE=true`) |

> **What happens if a permission is missing?** The app degrades gracefully. Missing cost data means cost columns show "N/A". Missing workspace data means workspace names show "Unknown". Missing AI permissions means AI buttons show an error message. Missing Lakebase means no persistence. The dashboard and warehouse monitor always work as long as the core system table permissions are granted.

| `DATABASE_URL` | `app.yaml` → secret or resource | Lakebase connection string |

### Set manually

| Variable | Where | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_MODE` | `app.yaml` or `.env.local` | `obo` (default) = use logged-in user's token; `sp` = always use service principal |
| `ENABLE_LAKEBASE` | `app.yaml` or `.env.local` | Set to `true` to enable persistence (default: `false`) |

## Unified Spark observability integration

The app now includes a contract-first path for unifying SQL and Spark observability:

- Canonical model: `docs/UNIFIED_OBSERVABILITY_MODEL.md`
- Serving views: `observability/sql/unified_views.sql`
- Spark ingestion module: `observability/python/spark_backend_ingest.py`
- Spark UI surface: `/spark-observability`
- Health endpoint: `/api/observability-health`

### Integration sequence

1. Run Spark profiling jobs from your external profiler workflow to populate source tables (`Applications`, `jobs`, `stages`, `photonanalysis`).
2. Schedule `spark_backend_ingest.py` to load canonical tables into `UNIFIED_OBSERVABILITY_CATALOG.UNIFIED_OBSERVABILITY_SCHEMA`.
3. Apply `observability/sql/unified_views.sql` to publish serving views.
4. Deploy app and validate `/spark-observability`.

### Additional grants for unified Spark views

```sql
GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG main TO `<principal>`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA main.unified_observability TO `<principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW main.unified_observability.v_observability_scorecard TO `<principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW main.unified_observability.v_spark_job_hotspots TO `<principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW main.unified_observability.v_spark_stage_hotspots TO `<principal>`;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW main.unified_observability.v_photon_opportunities TO `<principal>`;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard shows no data | User (OBO) or service principal (SP) lacks system table access | Grant `SELECT` on system tables — see [Permissions reference](#permissions-reference) |
| Jobs Health shows error | Missing `system.lakeflow.*` permissions | Grant `SELECT` on `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline`, `job_task_run_timeline`, and `jobs` |
| "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS" on `workspaces_latest` | User lacks access to `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Grant `SELECT` or ignore — workspace names show "Unknown" but dashboard still loads |
| Cost columns show "N/A" | Missing billing table permissions | Grant `SELECT` on `system.billing.usage` and `system.billing.list_prices` |
| AI buttons show errors | `ai_query()` not available | Grant `EXECUTE` on `ai_query()`, or ignore (AI is optional) |
| Job p95 duration shows "—" | All `run_duration_seconds` values are 0 in system tables | The app handles this with wall-clock fallback; redeploy if running a stale build |
| "The service principal lacks the required Databricks permissions" | OBO is not active; app fell back to SP which lacks permissions | Ensure user authorization scopes are configured (Step 5) and `AUTH_MODE` is `obo` (or unset) |
| "PERMISSION_DENIED" in logs | User or SP lacks a specific permission | Check which API/table failed and grant the corresponding permission |
| App stuck on "Starting" | Build failed | Check the **Logs** tab for npm or TypeScript errors |
| Blank page after deploy | Missing warehouse resource | Ensure `sql-warehouse` resource is added (Step 4) |

### Checking logs

1. Go to **Compute > Apps** in your workspace
2. Click your app
3. Click the **Logs** tab
4. Look for lines starting with `[warehouse-health]`, `[ai-triage]`, or `[rest-client]` for diagnostic info

## Security

- **Read-only**: The app only reads system tables and REST APIs. It does not write to Unity Catalog, modify warehouses, or create compute resources.
- **No external calls**: All data stays within your Databricks workspace. The app makes no calls to external services.
- **On-behalf-of-user (OBO) authentication**: By default, all SQL queries and REST API calls execute under the logged-in user's identity via the Databricks Apps `x-forwarded-access-token` proxy. This means each user's Unity Catalog permissions (including row-level filters and column masks) are enforced automatically. OBO tokens are per-request and never stored — the Databricks Apps proxy handles token refresh. Set `AUTH_MODE=sp` to fall back to service principal identity if needed.
- **Audit trail**: In OBO mode, queries appear in `system.query.history` under the actual user's identity, not the service principal — providing accurate attribution for compliance and audit.
- **PII handling**: Query text from `system.query.history` is displayed in the UI. If your queries contain sensitive data in string literals, the AI triage feature normalises literals in SQL fingerprints. Consider row-level security on system tables if needed.
- **No secrets in code**: All credentials are injected via environment variables or Databricks secret scopes.
