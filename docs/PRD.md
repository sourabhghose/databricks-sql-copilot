# Unified Observability Co-Pilot — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Name

Unified Observability Co-Pilot

### 1.2 One-Liner

A single Databricks App that surfaces SQL warehouse performance bottlenecks and Databricks Jobs health, diagnoses root causes with AI, and recommends optimizations — all from data already in system tables.

### 1.3 Origin

This product merges two independent internal projects:

- **DBSQL Co-Pilot** (`databricks-sql-copilot`): A Next.js Databricks App that reads `system.query.history` and related system tables to surface slow SQL queries, score them by business impact, and generate AI-powered rewrites.
- **Spark Observability Agent** (`spark-observability-agent`): A notebook-based toolkit that extracts Spark History Server metrics from Databricks clusters, produces analytics tables, and exposes LLM tools for natural-language performance tuning.

Neither project alone covers the full observability picture. SQL teams miss Spark job context; Spark analysts lack warehouse-level cost and queue pressure data. This PRD defines the unified product that closes both gaps.

### 1.4 Status

Alpha. Internal use only. Not a Databricks product. SQL observability and Jobs Health features are fully functional. Spark observability (SHS-based) is planned but not yet integrated.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Who Has This Problem

- **Platform engineers** responsible for cost and performance across SQL warehouses and Spark clusters.
- **Data engineers** running mixed SQL + Spark workloads who need a single pane of glass.
- **Solutions architects** advising customers on Databricks performance and Photon migration.

### 2.2 Current Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact |
|---|---|
| SQL and Spark performance insights live in separate tools with different auth models | Context-switching wastes 30-60 min per investigation |
| Spark profiling requires notebook execution with brittle cookie-based auth | Not suitable for always-on monitoring; breaks on session expiry |
| No unified scoring model spans SQL query patterns and Spark jobs | Can't prioritize "fix this SQL query vs. tune that Spark job" |
| Photon opportunity analysis is disconnected from SQL cost data | Hard to build a business case for migration without combined ROI |
| No freshness SLOs exist for observability data | Teams don't know when data is stale vs. when there's a real outage |

### 2.3 Why Now

- Databricks system tables (`system.query.history`, `system.compute.warehouses`, `system.billing.usage`) are GA and stable.
- Databricks Apps support OBO authentication, enabling per-user identity without custom auth infrastructure.
- Foundation Model APIs (Llama 4 Maverick, Claude Opus 4.6) are available via `ai_query()` for pay-per-token AI enrichment.
- Spark-observability-agent has matured to produce consistent table outputs from Databricks clusters.

## 3. Goals and Non-Goals

### 3.1 Goals

| ID | Goal | Success Metric |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | One app URL for all SQL + Spark observability | Single deployment, single nav bar |
| G2 | One auth story (OBO by default, SP fallback) | No browser-cookie dependencies in production |
| G3 | Unified impact scoring across SQL and Spark | Scorecard view comparing SQL and Spark KPIs side-by-side |
| G4 | Photon opportunity surfaced alongside SQL cost data | Photon tab shows estimated savings in dollar terms |
| G5 | Configurable freshness SLOs with health endpoint | `/api/observability-health` returns breach list |
| G6 | Graceful degradation when Spark data is unavailable | SQL features work fully; Spark tabs show "not yet ingested" |

### 3.2 Non-Goals (v1)

| ID | Non-Goal | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| NG1 | Non-Databricks compute support | Out of scope; Databricks clusters and warehouses only |
| NG2 | Write-back actions (auto-resize, auto-optimize) | Read-only for safety and audit compliance |
| NG3 | Real-time streaming Spark metrics | Batch ingestion is sufficient; SHS APIs are not streaming-friendly |
| NG4 | Task-level Spark metrics in the app | Optional in ingestion; too granular for v1 UI |
| NG5 | Multi-workspace federation (single unified deployment) | Each workspace gets its own app instance |

---

## 4. Target Users and Personas

### 4.1 Platform Admin (Primary)

Manages 5-50 SQL warehouses and dozens of Spark clusters. Needs a daily dashboard to triage the top-N most expensive workloads, whether SQL or Spark, and assign follow-up.

### 4.2 Data Engineer (Secondary)

Owns a specific pipeline with SQL stages (MERGE, INSERT) and Spark stages (ETL jobs). Needs to drill into a single job's stage bottlenecks and understand if Photon would help.

### 4.3 Solutions Architect (Tertiary)

Running a POC or health check for a customer. Needs to deploy the app, run profiling, and present a unified performance report in under an hour.

| Deployment manifest | Databricks Apps YAML | `app.yaml` |
| Asset Bundle config | Databricks DAB | `databricks.yml`, `resources/` |

### 5.3 Data Flow

1. **SQL path (live):** App queries `system.query.history` and related tables directly through the SQL warehouse on every page load. Results are cached for 5 minutes via Next.js `revalidate`.

2. **Spark path (batch):** A scheduled Databricks Job runs `spark_backend_ingest.py`, which reads profiler output tables (`Applications`, `jobs`, `stages`, `photonanalysis`) and writes canonical Delta tables (`spark_job_runs_v1`, `spark_stage_bottlenecks_v1`, `photon_opportunity_v1`). The app reads these through serving views.

3. **AI path (on-demand):** AI triage runs automatically on dashboard load (Llama 4 Maverick, fast). Deep analysis and SQL rewrites run on user click (Claude Opus 4.6, thorough). Both use `ai_query()` pay-per-token billing.

---

## 7. Data Model

### 7.1 Canonical Tables

All tables live in a configurable Unity Catalog location (default: `main.unified_observability`).

| Table | Source | Grain |
|---|---|---|
| `query_runs_v1` | `system.query.history` | One row per SQL statement execution |
| `spark_job_runs_v1` | SHS `jobs` + `Applications` | One row per Spark job |
| `spark_stage_bottlenecks_v1` | SHS `stages` + `Applications` | One row per Spark stage |
| `photon_opportunity_v1` | SHS `photonanalysis` | One row per Spark job |
| `observability_incidents_v1` | Generated from both sources | One row per detected incident |

### 7.2 Contract Rules

- Every table includes `workspace_id`, `source_system`, `ingest_ts`.
- Tables are append-only at ingest time.
- Serving views apply freshness windows and deduplicate by latest `ingest_ts`.
- Cross-source joins happen only through canonical IDs in serving views.

### 7.3 Serving Views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `v_observability_scorecard` | 24h aggregated KPIs + freshness metadata |
| `v_sql_query_hotspots` | SQL query hotspot pass-through |
| `v_spark_job_hotspots` | Spark job hotspot pass-through |
| `v_spark_stage_hotspots` | Stage bottleneck pass-through |
| `v_photon_opportunities` | Photon opportunity pass-through |

Full view DDL is in `observability/sql/unified_views.sql`.

---

## 8. Freshness SLOs

| Signal | Default SLO | Configurable Via |
|---|---|---|
| SQL query data | 30 minutes | `SQL_FRESHNESS_SLO_MINUTES` |
| Spark job/stage data | 2 hours | `SPARK_FRESHNESS_SLO_MINUTES` |
| Photon opportunity data | 24 hours | `PHOTON_FRESHNESS_SLO_MINUTES` |

The `/api/observability-health` endpoint returns:

- Per-signal age in minutes
- SLO thresholds
- List of breached signals
- Overall status: `healthy` or `degraded`

---

## 9. Authentication and Authorization

### 9.1 Identity Model

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| OBO (default) | Deployed as Databricks App | SQL and REST calls run as the logged-in user via `x-forwarded-access-token` |
| SP | `AUTH_MODE=sp` | All calls run as the app's service principal |
| PAT | Local dev | Personal access token from `.env.local` |

### 9.2 Required Permissions

**System tables (OBO users or SP):**

| Permission | Resource | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| `SELECT` | `system.query.history` | SQL Dashboard |
| `SELECT` | `system.compute.warehouses` | Warehouse Monitor/Health |
| `SELECT` | `system.compute.clusters` | Genie Space |
| `SELECT` | `system.billing.usage` | Cost allocation (SQL + Jobs) |
| `SELECT` | `system.billing.list_prices` | Dollar cost estimation |
| `SELECT` | `system.lakeflow.job_run_timeline` | Jobs Health dashboard |
| `SELECT` | `system.lakeflow.job_task_run_timeline` | Job task-level breakdown |
| `SELECT` | `system.lakeflow.jobs` | Job metadata (names, creators) |
| `SELECT` | `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Workspace names (optional) |
| `EXECUTE` | `ai_query()` | AI triage, analysis, rewrite (optional) |

**Unified observability views (OBO users or SP):**

| Permission | Resource |
|---|---|
| `USE CATALOG` | Target catalog (e.g., `main`) |
| `USE SCHEMA` | `unified_observability` |
| `SELECT` | All `v_*` views |

### 9.3 Graceful Degradation Matrix

| Missing Permission | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `system.billing.usage` | Cost columns show "N/A" on SQL and Jobs dashboards |
| `system.billing.list_prices` | Dollar amounts unavailable; DBU counts still shown |
| `system.access.workspaces_latest` | Workspace names show "Unknown" |
| `system.lakeflow.*` | Jobs Health page shows error; SQL dashboard unaffected |
| `ai_query()` | AI features disabled; rule-based flags still work on both SQL and Jobs |
| Unified Spark views | Spark tab shows "No data available — run ingestion" |
| Lakebase | No persistence; actions and cache reset on restart |

---

## 10. AI Strategy

### 10.1 Principle

The AI is the **explainer and rewriter**, not the primary detector. Rule-based detection is fast, free, deterministic, and consistent. AI confirms, refines, and expands.

### 10.2 Models

| Model | Purpose | Trigger | Billing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | Fast SQL triage (one-liner per query pattern) | Auto on dashboard load | PPT |
| `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | Deep SQL diagnosis + SQL rewrite | User clicks "AI Analyse" on a query | PPT |
| `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | Job triage (one-liner per job with metrics) | Auto on Jobs Health page load | PPT |
| `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | Job deep analysis (phase, task, duration) | User clicks "AI Deep Analysis" on job detail | PPT |
| `databricks-claude-sonnet-4-5` | Operator Actions Summary (top-10 cross-cutting) | User clicks "Generate Actions" on main dashboard | PPT |

### 10.3 Context Enrichment

**SQL AI prompts include:**
- Query SQL text and execution metrics
- Unity Catalog table metadata (`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`)
- Table maintenance history (`describe_history()`, `DESCRIBE DETAIL`)
- Warehouse configuration
- Performance flags already detected by rules

**Job AI triage prompts include:**
- Run count, success rate, p95/avg duration ratio
- Setup and queue time percentages
- Trigger type and failure patterns

**Job deep analysis prompts include:**
- Full run history with per-run phase durations
- Task-level breakdown (success rates, execution times, top termination codes)
- Phase statistics (setup/queue/execution percentages)
- Coefficient of variation, p95/p50 ratios
- Compute-level patterns (queue pressure, setup overhead)

**Operator Actions Summary prompts include:**
- Top problematic SQL queries (slow, spilling, poor pruning)
- Top failing/slow jobs with cost data
- Table scan hotspots across both SQL and jobs
- Cross-cutting patterns for unified recommendations

### 10.4 AI Quality Controls

- All AI prompts include "Hard rules" that enforce specific, data-backed recommendations
- Generic advice (e.g., "review logs") is explicitly prohibited in prompt engineering
- Every recommendation must reference a specific table, query, or job from the data
- Actionable commands (SQL, CLI) are included where applicable

---

## 11. Deployment

### 11.1 App Deployment

Deploy as a Databricks App using `app.yaml`:

```yaml
command:
  - "sh"
  - "scripts/start.sh"

env:
  - name: DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID
    valueFrom: sql-warehouse
  - name: UNIFIED_OBSERVABILITY_CATALOG
    value: "main"
  - name: UNIFIED_OBSERVABILITY_SCHEMA
    value: "unified_observability"
  - name: SPARK_HOTSPOT_LIMIT
    value: "25"
  - name: SQL_FRESHNESS_SLO_MINUTES
    value: "30"
  - name: SPARK_FRESHNESS_SLO_MINUTES
    value: "120"
  - name: PHOTON_FRESHNESS_SLO_MINUTES
    value: "1440"
```

### 11.2 Spark Ingestion Deployment

Schedule `observability/python/spark_backend_ingest.py` as a Databricks Job:

```
python spark_backend_ingest.py \
  --source-catalog main \
  --source-schema spark_observability \
  --target-catalog main \
  --target-schema unified_observability \
  --source-system spark_databricks
```

Recommended cadence: every 1-2 hours.

### 11.3 Rollout Sequence

1. Run Spark profiler notebooks to populate source tables.
2. Schedule `spark_backend_ingest.py` job.
3. Apply `observability/sql/unified_views.sql`.
4. Grant permissions on unified views.
5. Deploy app via `databricks apps deploy`.
6. Validate SQL Dashboard, Spark Observability, and `/api/observability-health`.

## 12. Cost Model

### 12.1 Estimated Monthly Cost (Moderate Use)

| Component | Estimate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SQL Warehouse (system table queries) | $3-10 | 10 dashboard loads/day, partition-pruned |
| AI Pay-Per-Token | $5-15 | 10 triage batches + 5 deep analyses/day |
| Databricks App hosting | $16-270 | Medium app; $16 at 2h/day, $270 at 24/7 |
| Lakebase (optional) | $25 | XS instance for caching |
| Spark ingestion job | $1-5 | Small job cluster, hourly runs |
| **Total (typical)** | **$25-60** | Without Lakebase, intermittent app use |

### 12.2 Cost Controls

- App can be stopped/started on demand.
- `SPARK_HOTSPOT_LIMIT` caps query result sizes.
- AI triage uses the cheaper Llama model for batch; expensive Claude is on-demand only.
- Ingestion frequency is configurable via job schedule.

---

## 13. Security

- **Read-only**: The app does not write to Unity Catalog, modify warehouses, or create compute.
- **No external calls**: All data stays within the Databricks workspace.
- **OBO authentication**: Per-user identity enforced by Databricks Apps proxy. UC permissions (including row-level filters and column masks) apply automatically.
- **Audit trail**: In OBO mode, queries appear in `system.query.history` under the actual user.
- **No secrets in code**: All credentials injected via environment variables.
- **PII handling**: Query text from system tables is displayed in the UI. AI triage normalizes literals. Consider row-level security for sensitive workloads.

## 16. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spark profiler source table schema changes | Medium | High | Ingestion module uses COALESCE and CAST for resilience; canonical contract is versioned (`_v1`) |
| SHS cookie auth deprecation | High | Medium | Ingestion module uses SP/OAuth; cookie path is only for legacy live-fetch |
| AI model availability or cost increase | Low | Medium | AI is optional; rule-based detection works independently |
| Canonical table volume growth (append-only) | Medium | Low | Add retention policy via Delta OPTIMIZE + VACUUM; serving views filter by freshness |
| Permission grants across many users | Medium | Medium | Recommend group-based grants; document in deployment guide |

## 19. Success Criteria

| Criterion | Measurement |
|---|---|
| One app URL covers SQL + Spark | Single deployment with all tabs functional |
| No cookie-based auth in production | Ingestion uses SP/OAuth; app uses OBO |
| Freshness SLOs enforced | `/api/observability-health` returns correct breach status |
| Graceful degradation proven | SQL features work when Spark tables are missing |
| < $60/month operating cost | Measured over 30 days of moderate use |
