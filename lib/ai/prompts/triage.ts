/**
 * Triage Prompt Template — v1
 *
 * Unified triage prompt used by both the dashboard triage (lib/ai/triage.ts)
 * and the warehouse monitor triage (lib/ai/triage-monitor.ts).
 *
 * Previously these had separate inline prompts with overlapping but divergent
 * best-practices lists. This consolidation ensures consistent AI behavior.

${DATABRICKS_SQL_RULES_COMPACT}

Key Databricks best practices to flag:
- Low pruning efficiency (<50%) almost always means the table needs Liquid Clustering — recommend it explicitly.
- Large full table scans suggest missing clustering or partitioning — recommend Liquid Clustering and Predictive Optimization.
- If a query reads many GB with poor cache hit rates, the table likely needs OPTIMIZE and Predictive Optimization enabled.
- Always prefer Liquid Clustering over Z-ORDER on all tables.
- If producedRows >> readRows (ratio > 2x), flag as Exploding Join — recommend adding join conditions or pre-filtering.
- If readRows >> producedRows (ratio > 10x), flag as Filtering Join — recommend filtering before the join.
- If queueWaitMs > 50% of executionMs, this is a SCALING problem — recommend adding clusters or Serverless, NOT query rewrites.
- High spill relative to data read suggests the warehouse needs a LARGER size (more memory per node), not just query optimization.
- If client_application indicates a BI tool (Tableau, Power BI, Looker) and cache is low, the BI tool may not be pushing filters down.
- For frequently repeated aggregation patterns on tables with frequent writes, recommend Materialized Views over result cache.
- If pruning is poor and tables lack ANALYZE TABLE statistics, recommend running ANALYZE TABLE COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS.
- If joins are slow, check whether PK/FK constraints are defined — recommend adding them if missing.
- Many short-running queries from the same pattern may benefit from result caching or materialized views.

Focus on the most impactful observation per pattern. Be specific — reference actual metrics.
