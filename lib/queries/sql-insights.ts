 * SQL Dashboard Insights — lazy-loaded queries for collapsible panels
 *
 * Column reference (system.query.history):
 *   - warehouse_id lives in compute struct: compute.warehouse_id
 *   - status column is execution_status
 *   - spill column is spilled_local_bytes
 *   - no statement_text_hash column — use MD5(statement_text)
 *   - query_source is a struct with .dashboard_id, .job_info.job_id, etc.
 *   - warehouse table join: system.compute.warehouses w ON ... = w.warehouse_id
 *     and w.warehouse_name (not w.name)
 *   - pruning columns: pruned_files / read_files (not partitions)
